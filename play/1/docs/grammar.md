## **Formal Grammar: A Comprehensive Guide**

Formal grammar is a set of rules that defines the syntax of a language, whether natural (e.g., English) or artificial (e.g., programming languages). 

In compiler and language design, formal grammars are crucial for parsing and interpreting source code.

---

## **1. What is Formal Grammar?**

A **formal grammar** is a mathematical model used to describe the syntax of a language. It consists of a set of **production rules** that define how symbols in the language can be combined to form valid expressions.

A formal grammar typically consists of four components:

1. **Terminals (T)** – The actual symbols (tokens) that appear in the language.
2. **Non-terminals (N)** – Abstract symbols that define language structure.
3. **Start Symbol (S)** – The entry point of the grammar.
4. **Production Rules (P)** – Rules that define how terminals and non-terminals are combined.

A grammar is written in **Backus-Naur Form (BNF)** or **Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF)**, both of which provide a structured notation for defining languages.

## **2. Types of Formal Grammars (Chomsky Hierarchy)**

The **Chomsky hierarchy** classifies formal grammars into four types, each with increasing expressive power.

| Grammar Type | Formal Definition | Example | Application |
|-------------|------------------|---------|------------|
| **Type 0: Unrestricted Grammar** | No constraints on production rules. | α → β (where α and β are any sequences of symbols) | Theoretically, all computable languages. |
| **Type 1: Context-Sensitive Grammar (CSG)** | Productions are of the form αAβ → αγβ (A is a non-terminal, γ is non-empty). | aAb → acb | Used in some natural language processing. |
| **Type 2: Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** | Productions have the form A → γ (A is a non-terminal, γ is a sequence of terminals and/or non-terminals). | E → E + E | Most programming languages and compilers use CFG. |
| **Type 3: Regular Grammar** | Productions have the form A → aB or A → a (A and B are non-terminals, a is a terminal). | A → 0A \| 1A \| ε | Regular expressions and lexical analysis. |

Most **programming languages** are defined using **Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)** because they balance **expressive power and efficient parsing**.

## **3. Examples of Formal Grammar**

### **a. Regular Grammar (Type 3) – Binary Strings Ending with 1**
```
S → 0S | 1S | 1
```
This grammar defines strings like `1`, `01`, `101`, `0001`, etc.

### **b. Context-Free Grammar (Type 2) – Simple Arithmetic Expressions**
```
E → E + E | E * E | (E) | num
```
This grammar generates expressions like `3 + 4`, `(2 * 5) + 3`, etc.

### **c. Context-Sensitive Grammar (Type 1) – Balanced Parentheses**
```
S → (S) | SS | ε
```
Valid examples: `()`, `(())`, `()()`.

## **4. Creating a Formal Grammar**

### **Step 1: Identify the Language**
Define what the language should express. Example: Arithmetic expressions.

### **Step 2: Define Terminals and Non-Terminals**
- Terminals: `+`, `*`, `(`, `)`, `num`.
- Non-Terminals: `E` (expression).

### **Step 3: Define Production Rules**
```
E → E + E
E → E * E
E → (E)
E → num
```
This defines valid arithmetic expressions.

### **Step 4: Test with Example Inputs**
Examples:  
✅ `(3 + 4) * 5` → Valid  
❌ `3 + * 4` → Invalid

### **Step 5: Refine and Optimise**
- Ensure **unambiguous** grammar (avoid multiple parse trees for the same input).
- Use **left-factored grammar** if implementing a **top-down parser**.

## **6. Additional Concepts Useful in Grammar Design**

### **a. Ambiguity in Grammars**
A grammar is **ambiguous** if there exists more than one valid parse tree for the same string.

Example:
```
E → E + E | E * E | num
```
For `3 + 4 * 5`, this grammar allows two parse trees:
1. `(3 + 4) * 5`
2. `3 + (4 * 5)`

**Solution:** Use precedence rules.
```
E → E + T | T
T → T * F | F
F → num | (E)
```

### **b. Left-Recursion Removal**
**Problem:** The rule `E → E + T` causes infinite recursion in top-down parsers.  
**Solution:** Convert to right recursion:
```
E → T E'
E' → + T E' | ε
```

### **c. Left Factoring**
If a grammar has common prefixes in multiple rules, it needs left-factoring.

Example (problematic):
```
S → if condition then S else S | if condition then S
```
Fix:
```
S → if condition then S S'
S' → else S | ε
```

### **d. Recursive Descent and LL(k) Parsers**
Some parsers require **LL(k) grammars**, which must be **left-factored** and **non-left-recursive**.

### **e. Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs)**
Unlike CFGs, PEGs define languages with **deterministic** parsing (useful for modern languages).
